**A three-level trend-following exposure engine — a risk-adjusted overlay that beats buy-&-hold on Sharpe across volatile names while cutting drawdown ~a fifth.**

> Companion write-up: [Three-Level Trend Following](https://josephmacri2.substack.com/p/three-level-trend-following-options)

StockOdds classifies each candle, rolls that up into a short-term and a long-term trend state, and maps the combined state to a **target market exposure** (0–100%), then scales how hard it leans long by each name's volatility and trend-persistence (the [dynamic long bias](#long-bias-fixed-or-dynamic-per-candle)). It sits in cash through sustained downtrends and re-enters as trends confirm — trading a slice of raw bull-market return for a **higher Sharpe and materially lower drawdown**.

---

## Goal

Deliver **better risk-adjusted return than buy-and-hold** on volatile names, while keeping drawdowns well below simply holding:

- **Raise Sharpe** and **return-per-drawdown** (Calmar) versus buy-&-hold.
- **Cut max drawdown** by stepping aside during confirmed downtrends (roughly a fifth shallower on the volatile basket, and shallower on ~84% of a broad random universe).
- Do this **without shorting** — bearish states mean "go to cash," not "go short."

It is most useful on **high-volatility names** where the trend timing and drawdown control both pay off. On calm, low-volatility names it tends to *underperform* buy-&-hold (there's no deep drawdown to dodge, so leaning long just tracks it at best), so deploy selectively — see [When to deploy](#when-to-deploy-it).

---

## How it works

Three stacked layers turn raw OHLC bars into a single exposure number:

### 1. Candle classification
Each bar is labeled relative to the previous bar:
- **Bull** — close above the prior bar's high
- **Bear** — close below the prior bar's low
- **Neutral** — anything in between (ignored by the state machines)

### 2. Short-term state (ST) — a 4-state machine
Tracks short runs of bull/bear candles:

| State | Enters when |
|---|---|
| **Bull** | two consecutive bull candles |
| **BullNeutral** | first bear candle interrupting a bull run |
| **BearNeutral** | first bull candle interrupting a bear run |
| **Bear** | two consecutive bear candles |

### 3. Long-term state (LT) — an anchor-based regime
A **Bull / Bear** regime driven by trailing anchors (the low/high of the 2nd-to-last candle in the current run). The regime flips to **Bull** when price closes above the bear anchor after a confirmed run, and to **Bear** when it closes below the bull anchor — a lagging, noise-resistant trend filter.

### 4. Exposure map → smoothing → position
The `(LT, ST)` pair maps to a signed target exposure (a gradient from most-bullish to most-bearish):

| | ST Bull | ST BullNeutral | ST BearNeutral | ST Bear |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LT Bull** | +100% | +50% | 0% | −50% |
| **LT Bear** | +50% | 0% | −50% | −100% |

That raw target is then:
1. **EMA-smoothed** (avoids whipsawing on single-bar state flips),
2. skewed by a **dynamic long-bias** (leans with the recent trend),
3. only **rebalanced when it drifts past a deadband** (cuts churn),
4. **clamped to `[0%, 100%]`** — so negative targets simply become **cash** (no short).

**Default parameters** (`Program.cs`): Exposure EMA `24`, Bias period `15`, Bias EMA `150`, Rebalance drift `30%`, exposure clamp `0–100%`. The **long bias is dynamic by default** — recomputed per candle from each name's volatility and exposure-persistence (see [Long bias](#long-bias-fixed-or-dynamic-per-candle) below); set `DynamicLongBias = false` for a single fixed `LongBias`. Smoothing knobs were validated as near-optimal and robust — see [Notes on tuning](#notes-on-tuning).

---

## Long bias: fixed or dynamic (per-candle)

The **long bias** controls how hard a bullish LT regime is leaned into. In the running trend sum, a Bull candle contributes `1 + bias/2` and a Bear candle `−1 + bias/2` (the [`BiasSplit`](#long-bias-fixed-or-dynamic-per-candle) default — the bias is a long tilt on *both* sides so conviction persists through chop; with `BiasSplit = false` it reverts to the classic `1 + bias` / `−1`). A larger bias pushes exposure up harder in uptrends.

### Dynamic long bias (the default)

Rather than one `LongBias` for every stock, the bias is **recomputed each candle** from a combined trait z-score, so quiet names lean long and hot names ease off — automatically, per name and over time:

```
z          = z(rolling HV) + z(rolling exposure-persistence)          // vs FIXED universe refs
raw        = DynBase · e^(−DynDecay · z)   (Exponential, default)     // or  DynBase + DynSlope · z  (Linear)
LongBias_t = EMA_smooth( clamp(raw, DynMin, DynMax) , DynSmoothPeriod )
```

- **`z` is absolute, not relative** — it uses fixed reference constants for the mean/std of HV and persistence, calibrated to the cross-sectional distribution of a ~110-name universe. So a stock's z reflects "how volatile / persistent is this name in absolute terms," not "vs its own recent history" (a chronically quiet name must read low, not drift to zero).
- **What it does:** a **quiet, steady** name (`z < 0`) gets a **large** bias — lean toward staying long, since it grinds up. A **hot** name (`z > 0`) gets a **small** bias — let the active signal do the work. `rolling HV` = annualized log-return stdev over `HvWindow`; `rolling persistence` = Kaufman efficiency ratio of the **raw `(LT,ST)` target exposure** over `PersistWindow` (1 = the state sequence trends and holds, 0 = it round-trips). It's measured on the raw target, *not* the exposure EMA, so the bias is **independent of `ExposureEmaPeriod`** — changing one smoothing knob doesn't move the other.
- **Smoothed:** the raw per-candle bias is jumpy (the persistence ratio moves fast on state transitions and the exponential is convex), so it's EMA-smoothed over `DynSmoothPeriod` to avoid whipsaw. Optionally a second, slower EMA (`DynSmoothSlow`, default **10** = off) can be added — `LongBias = min(fast, slow)` — so the lagging slow EMA caps *transient* spikes (the bias climbs only if the raw value is sustained). It's a **defensive dial**: `min(fast, slow) ≤ fast`, so it can only *trim* the bias. `DynSlowMult` multiplies the slow EMA before the `min`, so `< 1` lowers that ceiling *proportionally* — a cleaner, scale-aware cap than a fixed `DynMax`.

**Slow/fast EMA ratio (`BiasEmaRatio`, default on).** The bias is set to `(slowBiasEMA · DynSlowMult) · clamp(slowBiasEMA / fastBiasEMA, 0.25, 2.0)` — the *ceiling* scaled by a clamped slow/fast ratio. It's a *mean-reverting tilt on the bias's own level*, **monotonic** in the fast EMA: when the fast runs **above** the slow (the bias just spiked) the ratio is `< 1` and **damps** it; when the fast dips **below** (a recent pullback) the ratio is `> 1` and **lifts** it; `fast = slow` is neutral (= the plain ceiling). Using the ceiling as the base (rather than `min(fast, ceiling)`) keeps the curve monotonic — an earlier "tent" form peaked oddly at `fast = slow/2`. Unlike double-weighting the current window (which makes the level *more* reactive and hurt), this leans *against* recent bias moves and helps. Validated on a **broad random 500-name US-common-stock sample** *and against buy-&-hold*: it **closes most of the Sharpe gap to B&H** (0.13→0.17 vs 0.19) while keeping **~the entire drawdown edge** (shallower than B&H on **82%** of names, vs 83% without it), and it's best across the **50–100% HV deployment band** (at 75–100% it even edges B&H on Sharpe). The only give-up is on the extreme **>100% HV** names, where a couple pp more drawdown shows up. Set `BiasEmaRatio = false` for the plain ceiling'd bias.

**Split bias across LT directions (`BiasSplit`, default on).** In the rolling-sum that builds `biasEma`, a Bull candle contributes `1 + bias/2` and a Bear candle `−1 + bias/2` (instead of `1 + bias` / `−1`). The bias becomes a *long tilt on both sides*: it adds a constant `+bias/2` to the window regardless of how bull-heavy it is, so a high-bias (quiet + choppy) name keeps its conviction elevated *through* its LT-Bear stretches — a cleaner "hold through chop" than relying on a lingering `biasEma` from the prior bull. It trades a little bull-amplification (halved) for that hold. Validated on the **broad random 500** *and* against buy-&-hold: Sharpe up **in every HV bucket** (all-500 **0.17→0.20**, higher on 63% of names), and it **edges B&H on Sharpe overall** (0.20 vs 0.19) — which the strategy otherwise doesn't do on the broad universe — at **~flat drawdown** (only the extreme >100% HV bucket runs ~4pp deeper). Set `BiasSplit = false` for the classic long-only rolling sum.

**Slope-graded blend (`BlendSlope`, default on).** Modulates the [defensive/dynamic blend](#which-knob-when--biasblend-vs-biasnoinvert) by the *momentum of the plotted position itself*. Two EMAs of the final exposure are tracked — fast (`EMA12`) and slow (`EMA120`) — and when the fast EMA is **above** the slow **and rolling over** (falling over `BlendSlopeBars = 10`), the blend is pulled toward defensive *proportional to how steep the descent is*: `effBlend = clamp(1 + BlendSlopeK·grade, BlendSlopeFloor, 1)` with `grade = fastEMA − fastEMA[BlendSlopeBars] < 0`. That condition — the position pinned high then rolling over — is a *confirmed late-run top*, empirically the **lowest-forward-return zone** (measured on the plotted exposure, next-bar underlying return ~13% annualized vs ~32% when the fast EMA is still rising). Reading the position EMAs one bar lagged keeps it non-circular. It's **gentle by design**: a mild rollover barely moves the blend, only steep tops de-risk, so strong trends keep running (unlike a hard trim, which forfeits the resume). The `fast > slow` gate is essential — trimming on the slope *alone* over-de-levers (you're above the slow EMA through most of a bull run). Validated on the **broad random 500**: **OOS-neutral everywhere** (no Sharpe cost in any HV bucket — the first defensive modulation that clears the broad walk-forward without a penalty, because it's *targeted* rather than a blunt global de-lever), with its benefit **concentrated on volatile/trending names** where the roll-over condition actually occurs (high-vol basket: full-window Sharpe **0.48→0.50**, drawdown **53→52%**, return **166→181%**), and a **no-op on quiet names** (the condition rarely triggers). Set `BlendSlope = false` to restore the un-modulated blend; `BlendSlopeGate = false` turns it into a stronger (Sharpe-for-drawdown) de-lever.

**Smooth the final exposure (`FinalSmooth`, default on).** Every prior stage smooths an *input* — the target gets an EMA, the bias gets EMAs, the drift band gives the position discrete hysteresis — but the **final plotted position** (the blue line) was never continuously smoothed. `FinalSmooth` adds a short EMA (`FinalSmoothPeriod = 3`) on that last output. It damps the residual whipsaw/turnover — the rapid in-out churn on noise that erodes risk-adjusted return — at the cost of a little lag. **Broad random 500 validated, and it's the one modulation that *raises* broad OOS Sharpe rather than ties it** (0.27→0.28, positive in 4 of 5 HV buckets) while trimming ~1pt of drawdown; the only give-up is marginal absolute *return* (whipsaw, not trend). The effect is robust across periods 3–8 (not tuned to one), but the period must stay **short** — heavy smoothing (EMA20) over-lags and hands the gain back. It also **trades off with the raw `ExposureEmaPeriod`** (both smooth the same signal): the shipped pairing is a *longer* raw EMA (`24`) with a *lighter* final smooth (`3`) — a joint grid put the OOS on a flat plateau across raw 9–24 with matched final smoothing, and this corner is best on the extreme-vol tail (broad-500 tie on OOS overall, better `>100 HV` return/drawdown). If you drop the raw EMA back to `12`, bump the final smooth to `5`. Set `FinalSmooth = false` to plot/trade the raw drift-band position.

**Screening preset (the shipped default): `DynMax = 150`, `DynSmoothSlow = 150`, `DynSlowMult = 0.5`.** The bias ceiling is a *slow* 150-bar EMA of the raw bias, scaled to half — and `DynMax` is raised to 150 so the raw bias isn't pre-clamped and the slow-EMA×mult *is* the effective ceiling. This is a deliberate **defensive tilt tuned for the high-vol names you'd screen**: it still captures the runs (per-name compounds preserved/improved — SMCI 733%→765%, IREN 945%→1123%, HOOD 500%→524%) and is more robust through a real bear (full-window incl. 2022, HV-set Sharpe **0.43→0.47** at ~flat drawdown), at the cost of some **bull-only** OOS Sharpe (0.46→0.38). Two honest caveats: (1) it does **not** dominate on the bull-only walk-forward — no `DynMax`/slow/mult combination beats the neutral baseline on *both* the bull-only OOS *and* the full window; it's a Pareto frontier (aggression ⇄ drawdown / bull ⇄ bear), a risk-appetite choice; (2) the full-window edge leans on the **single, in-sample 2022 bear**, so the bear-robustness can't be confirmed out-of-sample. It also **requires the raised `DynMax`** — at `DynMax = 15` the same slow/mult over-clamps and craters names (SMCI 733%→94%). **Revert to the neutral baseline** with `DynMax = 15`, `DynSmoothSlow = 10` (= `DynSmoothPeriod`), `DynSlowMult = 1.0`.

**Knobs** (all on `BankrollSimulator`, hand-set — *not* fitted to returns): `DynScale` (default **Exponential**), `DynBase` (bias at `z = 0`, default **1**), `DynDecay` (default **0.6**) / `DynSlope`, `DynSmoothPeriod` (default **10**), `DynSmoothSlow` (default **150**) / `DynSlowMult` (default **0.5**), **`BiasEmaRatio`** (default **on**, clamp `0.25–2.0`), `DynMin`/`DynMax` (default `[0, 150]`), `HvWindow`/`PersistWindow` (**60 / 63**), refs `HvRefMean`/`HvRefStd` (**57 / 34.6**), `PersRefMean`/`PersRefStd` (**0.072 / 0.010**), **`BiasBlend`** (default **1.0** = pure dynamic), **`DefensiveBias`** (default **0.5**), **`BiasSplit`** (default **on**), **`BlendSlope`** (default **on**; `BlendSlopeK` **6**, `BlendSlowPeriod` **120**, `BlendSlopeBars` **10**, `BlendSlopeFloor` **0**, `BlendSlopeGate` **on**), **`FinalSmooth`** (default **on**, `FinalSmoothPeriod` **3**), **`BiasTiming`** (default **off**, band `0.75–1.25`) and **`BiasNoInvert`** (default **off**) — see below. Set `DynamicLongBias = false` to fall back to a single fixed `BankrollSimulator.LongBias`.

**Defensive ↔ dynamic blend (`BiasBlend`).** The engine computes *two* exposure skews each candle — a **defensive** one from `DefensiveBias` (default 0.5 — halves drawdown but lags the rockets) and the **dynamic** one above (captures the rockets, gives up some protection) — and blends them: `adjEma = |ema| · (BiasBlend·dynamic + (1−BiasBlend)·defensive) + ema`. It's a **risk dial**, not a free lunch: Sharpe and drawdown both rise smoothly with the weight (a frontier interpolation — no dominating middle). The default is **1.0 (pure dynamic)**; dial **down toward 0** to trade Sharpe for capital preservation. (Resist the urge to push it low to erase one name's worst drawdown — that's overfitting a tail; the dynamic default already turns a −95% buy-&-hold into ~−30%.) The blend only applies with dynamic on; `LongBias` is purely the dynamic-*off* fallback and has **no effect** while `DynamicLongBias = true`.

**No-invert guard (`BiasNoInvert`, default off).** The skew is `adjEma = |ema|·biasEma + ema`. For a *bullish* `ema` that's `ema·(1+biasEma)` — amplify the long. For a *bearish* `ema` it's `ema·(1−biasEma)`, which is fine while `biasEma ≤ 1` (trims the short toward flat) but **inverts** once `biasEma > 1` — and the dynamic bias routinely reaches ~3, so a bearish signal gets flipped into a *long that grows as the signal gets more bearish* (e.g. a name in a confirmed LT-Bear downtrend can sit pinned at 100% long the whole way down). `BiasNoInvert = true` caps this: the bias may pull a bearish `ema` to **flat (0)** but never past zero into a net long (bullish bars are untouched, so rocket-capture is unchanged). When the guard fires it also **bypasses the drift band** and snaps the position flat — a decisive exit rather than a within-band residual (`held` goes to 0, so re-entry stays symmetric and every other bar's rebalance is unchanged). It does **not** dominate on the broad universe (it's a Sharpe-for-drawdown trade there, 0.40→0.32 OOS), but on the **high-vol deployment set it's near-free** (0.42 vs 0.43 Sharpe, ~4 pts less drawdown) and it removes a genuine tail hazard — leveraging *into* a crash — that a bull-only walk-forward can't punish. Left off by default; worth turning on if you deploy on volatile names.

**Timing modulation (`BiasTiming`, default off).** *Level for direction, window for timing.* The level-amplified skew above decides **how bullish** (a high `biasEma` rides the runs); `BiasTiming` then nudges it by the **latest 15-bar window vs its own long-run norm**: `adjEma ×= clamp(dynBias / biasEma, 0.75, 1.25)`. When the recent window runs hot vs its norm (accelerating) exposure ticks up; when it cools (decelerating) it ticks down. The band is deliberately **tight** — on a real trender the skew already clamps to max, so the modulation is moot there; it only trims/adds in the *marginal* cases. (Widen it and it slides into the failure mode of a pure ratio model, which puts `biasEma` in the denominator and de-levers exactly the persistent winners.) **Its value flips with the bias-cap regime, which is why it's now default-off:** at the **neutral config** (`DynMax = 15`, `DynSlowMult = 1.0`, uncapped bias) it *adds* on hot windows and lifts the big-winner compounds at unchanged drawdown (NVDA 928%→981%, SMCI 526%→733%, AVGO 473%→527%) — a genuine win, so **turn it on there**. But at the **shipped screening default** (`DynMax = 150`, `DynSmoothSlow = 150`, `DynSlowMult = 0.5`) the slow-EMA ceiling *already* hard-caps the bias, so timing only trims an already-capped skew and mildly de-levers the winners (NVDA/OPEN/ASST/MSTR give back some compound return at ~flat Sharpe/drawdown). So it ships **off** under the capped default. Guarded off when `biasEma ≤ 0` (bearish regime — the level de-risks there already). Set `BiasTiming = true` to re-enable it (recommended only with the uncapped neutral config).

**Which knob when — `BiasBlend` vs `BiasNoInvert`.** They are *not* interchangeable. `BiasBlend` is the **global risk dial**: a smooth, monotonic control (OOS the whole frontier is clean — e.g. HV names 0.43/−33% at 1.0 → 0.34/−26% at 0.25) that trades Sharpe for drawdown across the *whole* book — dial it for your overall risk appetite. `BiasNoInvert` is a **surgical, binary per-name override**: it removes *only* the pathological leverage-into-a-crash (a bearish signal flipped long by `biasEma > 1`) while leaving genuine upside untouched — so on a name you've judged is truly rolling over it can protect the downside *without* sacrificing the run if you're wrong (it took one such name to a *higher* return than the default, not lower). Use `BiasBlend` to set book-wide defensiveness; reach for `BiasNoInvert` only as a targeted switch on a specific name. Note the one thing *neither* can do: separate a recoverable pullback from a real decline *in advance* — at the decision bar those look identical in every available feature (z, HV, persistence, regime), so it's an irreducible judgment call, which is exactly why the surgical override is left to you rather than automated.

**Why it's the default — and its honest limits.** On a 110-name walk-forward (~5y OOS) the default `exp / 1 / 0.6` **beats a fixed `LongBias = 0.5`** (mean OOS Sharpe **0.43 vs 0.16**, return **+17% vs +10%**) *and* cuts drawdown — a real, out-of-sample improvement, so it's on by default. It also finally handles the high-vol, low-persistence names (e.g. AEHR/SMCI) that a fixed low bias whipsawed: their low persistence pulls z negative, so they get a high bias and stay long through their runs. Two caveats kept in view: (1) it does **not** beat a *high* fixed bias (~10) on raw Sharpe/return — that captures more of a bull run but gives back drawdown protection; (2) the piece that **provably generalizes OOS is the drawdown reduction**, not return outperformance vs buy-&-hold. This is a risk overlay, not an alpha engine — consistent with the strategy's stated goal.

The dynamic bias is mirrored in the Pine scripts (on by default): watch `LongBias` change per candle via the orange stepline, the table row, and the Data Window (`DBG Dyn LongBias` / `DBG z`).

## What to expect

Backtested over each name's full available history (~5 years, **including the 2022 bear market**), the **shipped default** (dynamic long bias on — z-scaled, slow/fast-modulated, and split across both LT directions; see below), no per-symbol tuning:

| Symbol | HV | Strat Sharpe | B&H Sharpe | Strat MaxDD | B&H MaxDD | Strat Ret/DD | B&H Ret/DD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| KO | 17 | **0.54** | 0.52 | **−20%** | −21% | 2.1 | **2.2** |
| ^GSPC | 17 | **0.85** | 0.72 | **−18%** | −25% | **4.3** | 2.9 |
| NVDA | 51 | **1.32** | 1.17 | **−54%** | −66% | **19.2** | 14.9 |
| MSTR | 91 | **0.60** | 0.52 | −87% | **−84%** | **1.5** | 1.1 |
| ASTS | 104 | **0.93** | 0.80 | **−75%** | −86% | **11.7** | 4.8 |
| SMR | 99 | **0.74** | 0.43 | **−79%** | −87% | **2.8** | −0.3 |
| OPEN | 109 | **0.87** | 0.32 | **−69%** | −98% | **10.3** | −0.7 |

**Basket aggregate (17 volatile names):** mean Sharpe **0.73 vs 0.58** (strategy higher on **16/17**), mean max drawdown **−57.1% vs −69.5%** — a **shallower drawdown on 16 of 17 names** (≈ a fifth less, on average).

> ⚠️ **In-sample vs out-of-sample — read this.** The table above is *full-window*, so it includes the **2022 bear** the strategy dodges — part of the Sharpe edge comes from there. Out of sample the gap to buy-&-hold is now **narrow, not adverse** (it used to trail): on the high-vol deployment set, a bull-only rolling walk-forward (2023–2026 — no bear falls inside any test window) has the strategy **essentially tying buy-&-hold on Sharpe (≈0.83 vs 0.85, winning 2/4 folds)** while still cutting fold drawdown (**~42% vs 48%**); and on a **broad random 500-name US-common-stock sample** it now **edges buy-&-hold on Sharpe (0.20 vs 0.19)** while staying shallower on drawdown for ~84% of names. So the honest read: since the bias reforms this is a **capital-preservation overlay that roughly matches-or-beats buy-&-hold on risk-adjusted return** rather than trailing it — but its clearest, most *durable* edge is still **drawdown reduction**, and the full-window Sharpe lead leans partly on the single in-sample 2022 bear (which can't be re-confirmed out-of-sample — Yahoo caps history at ~5y).

### The trade-off, honestly
- **It captures the high-vol runs rather than sitting them out.** The bias leans long into volatile names that trend (ASTS: Sharpe **0.93 vs 0.80**, drawdown **−75% vs −86%**, Ret/DD **11.7 vs 4.8**; OPEN **0.87 vs 0.32**) — where a fixed low bias used to lag buy-&-hold, it now beats it.
- **The drawdown cut is real but modest — and the newer, more aggressive bias trades some of it for return.** ≈ a fifth shallower vs buy-&-hold on the basket (was ~a quarter with the earlier, tamer bias; ~half with a pure defensive config). On a few extreme names it can even run *deeper* than buy-&-hold (MSTR: −87% vs −84%) when it holds a crashing name long. For maximum capital preservation instead, dial `BiasBlend` down toward 0, or set `DynamicLongBias = false` with a low fixed `LongBias`.
- **On low-vol names it roughly tracks buy-&-hold** (KO: 0.54 vs 0.52 — a near-tie now, not a clear lag): no deep drawdown to dodge, so leaning long just matches it at best. Across the broad universe the calm 0–25% HV bucket still trails slightly (≈0.38 vs 0.44). Don't expect an edge there.
- **This basket is high-vol-favorable.** Across a broad random 500-name universe the strategy now **edges buy-&-hold on Sharpe (0.20 vs 0.19)** — a razor-thin lead — while cutting drawdown on ~84% of names. The drawdown edge is the part that generalizes strongly; the Sharpe outperformance is thin and strongest on volatile names.

### When to deploy it
- **Deploy on high-volatility names (roughly HV ≥ 50).** That's where the dynamic bias, trend timing, and drawdown control all pay off — the strategy beats buy-and-hold on Sharpe *and* Calmar there.
- **Skip low-volatility names.** Below ~HV 25 it tracks or lags buy-&-hold; there's no drawdown to protect against.
- **Long-or-cash only.** Allowing shorts (`MinExposure = −100%`) was tested and made every metric *worse* — bearish signals are best expressed as cash.

## Notes on tuning

This project was stress-tested for overfitting, and the findings shaped the defaults:

- **Parameter tuning does not survive out-of-sample.** Per-symbol grid search *lost* to a fixed global default on held-out data (overfit decay ~1.3 Sharpe). Rolling walk-forward over both the smoothing knobs and the exposure map showed no durable *alpha*.
- **The smoothing knobs are second-order.** Sharpe barely moves across a wide range of them; the current values sit in the ~92nd percentile and are treated as fixed.
- **The strategy's real, robust value is drawdown reduction** — which *is* consistent out-of-sample and across a full market cycle.
- **Don't tune to a single symbol.** Individual names vary widely around the average; that dispersion is expected noise, not a defect to be fit away.
